        <p> “You need to use when you have to, such as when it’s raining. Or, when you just feel like it. Sometimes you wear it because you need to get the sun out of your eyes. Think about flash in the same way. Don’t use it all the time, but also don’t shy away from it. If it’s dark outside, use flash. If you know there’s time, and you have a good idea, and your clients will love it, then go for it.”

        <p >Do images truly express as much as words do - or even more? Why do some pictures evoke strong emotions within us or strike a chord deep within? <br>You may or may not have answers to such questions. But what you have here is a well-curated list of words of wisdom or witty one-liners from photographers who have wowed us with their stellar images. This is a collection of famous photography quotes on their observations about their art, passion, and profession.
        </p>
        <p>For me, documentary photography has always come with great responsibility. Not just to tell the story honestly and with empathy, but also to make sure the right people hear it. When you photograph somebody who is in pain or discomfort, they trust you to make sure the images will act as their advocate.</p>
